And definitely no unconstitutional last minute rule changes by state judiciaries and governors when only the legislature is allowed to do that. And that one lady who got busted for ballot harvesting definitely didn’t exist either. Since the whole thing was so fair and uncorrupt none of the canvassers in any state had to threaten other canvasser’s kids in order to force a certification vote. And, of course, all poll watchers where granted meaningful access to observe the count and we’re definitely not told to go home in the middle of the night while counting continued. Every state followed through with their signature verification and safeguards with perfection and there was definitely no imbalances of 170k votes in any county. Not a single state used a voter registration roll that hadn’t been purged in 10 years and it is totally normal for more votes to be cast than eligible voters exist. There was also absolutely no need for big tech and the corporate press that had been suppressing stories leading up to the election to further suppress information about any funny business that definitely didn’t occur. There where definitely no dead people or illegals voting or any illegal addresses used for registrants and, of course, no one voted twice or voted from out of state. Vote counting definitely didn’t ever stop in the middle of the night for dubious reasons followed by massive vote dumps that resembled elections in corrupt countries like the Philippines. In fact, mail-in voting is so secure and fail proof that Amazon is going to allow it for its employees to vote on unionizing...  Nah, you’re right.

And, of course, we got a ton of full, robust, and transparent investigations into every major claim in order to ease the voter\\'s concerns over election integrity. I know it might be hard to believe but even though we completely overhauled the entire election process nation wide in a matter of months, we didn\\'t have a single issue anywhere!

The real power of PCR is to give a qualitative answers but they are being used to give a binary positive/negative result. PCR can show that viral matter is present but it does not show you whether a person is actually infectious or not. When PCR is run at excessively high amplification cycles you can pretty much pick up the tiniest amounts of noninfectious viral debris which is totally irrelevant to determining if someone is actually infected.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I have a feeling the kary mullis quote your referring to is the one about his comments regarding HIV patients that has frequently been taken wildly out of context.  If you are referring to the Reuters fact-check of a quote that was misattributed to Mullis then no, I\\'m not. Even in that fact-check they label it as misleading by being misleading themselves. They acknowledge that PCR cannot detect live virus (which is what they whole debate is all about to begin with) by making a pseudo-strawman argument that PCR is \"fraudulent.\" No one claims that you can\\'t detect viral matter using PCR with enough cycles. Instead, they argue that PCR is not a sufficient way of determining if someone is infectious which even Reuters admitted was true.  I was referring more to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT3IqZjT_9A&amp;feature=emb_title) quote where he very plainly states that PCR does not tell you if you are sick and how you can use PCR to \"find anything in anybody\". [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aISPlTLbJo) is also a fun one where he shits on Fauci.',\n",
       " '&gt;That is precisely the misleading quote! Havr you listened to that quote in its entirety?He\\'s specifically referencing HIV patients who, due to their immune suppression, will most likely have many types of virus in their body.  He is referring to researchers using PCR to look for HIV in patients in order to create a causal link between HIV and AIDS. So no, I am not taking the quote out of context and it\\'s relationship to HIV does not detract from what he was saying. Furthermore, every fact-check I have seen on this doesn\\'t actually fact check the actual claim. As I mentioned they attack a pseudo-strawman argument that states that PCR can\\'t detect viral matter instead of the actual argument that PCR alone is not sufficient to determine if someone is sick/infectious. You cannot determine a case (using the actual medical terminology) from a PCR test.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Hes not saying that PCR is too broad at all. Mullis also believed, when it was already shown conclusively, that HIV did not cause aids, I dont care at all what he thinks about Fauci.  Again, he was critical of using overly sensitive PCR to find HIV in people with AIDS in order to establish a causal relationship between the two. The reason Fauci is relevant in all of this is because he was pushing hard for an HIV vaccine back in the 90s after he wasted hundreds of millions of dollars in the 80s by diverting research away from promising anti-retroviral drugs to fight AIDS in favor of a vaccine approach which cost millions of lives. It\\'s also worth looking into Fauci\\'s botched anthrax vaccine and wasteful swine flue vaccine.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;It does not matter that the PCR is being used to test for a binary metric, as you can use it in context of other patient details to determine whether you actively have Covid. Even at excessively high amplification cycles, PCR can be a forward leaning test .  They aren\\'t considering anything other than a positive PCR test when it comes to recording a case which is what I have been arguing against. If they used a reasonable Ct and observe actual systems to determine a case then that would be fine but they are doing the opposite. They are using overly sensitive tests as the exclusive metric for whether some is considered infected. There is no justification for pushing amplification cycles to extreme levels just to force a positive test result other than to intentionally inflate numbers. The only reason anyone would want to intentionally inflate numbers is so they can achieve some ulterior motive by exploiting public panic.  Incidentally, the WHO just updated their interim guidance which agrees with my statements that PCR is little more than an \"aid for diagnosis\" but is not the sole indicator of infection nor should high Ct tests be trusted (\"coincidentally\" on the same day that Joe Biden was inaugurated). They now say that a positive PCR test by itself is inconclusive for a determining a COVID infection if a tested person exhibits no symptoms. It turns out that all of the crazy conspiracy theorists have actually been right for the past 7 months.',\n",
       " '&gt;What do you think a qualitative output for PCR is supposed to be?  A yes/no answer as to the presence of viral material is exactly what this test is designed for.  PCR was not designed to be a test, it was designed for biologists to be able to amplify small amounts of DNA to a level that they could study. It was meant to be a qualitative tool for observing trace amounts of biological molecules, not a binary test for determining infections.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You are correct that dead viral material can trigger a positive result so, in some cases, \"active PCR\" may be a misnomer, but that is still a confirmed infection even if they aren\\'t infectious at the time of the test.  No, it\\'s not a confirmed infection. Simply having viral particles in your body does not mean that you are infected. As per the Mullis quote I linked, with PCR \"you can find almost anything in anybody.\"  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If anything, that type of positive is more concerning because it means they just spent days/weeks being an infectious risk without knowing it and are only now learning that they should have been quarantined.  Researchers have found that they are not able to culture virus from PCR samples that require a high cycle threshold (beyond 34 Ct) to generate a positive test result. So if someone tests positive using an overly sensitive test (which is the norm for the USA and Europe) then there is no guarantee that they are actually infectious. The University of Florida Department of Biostatistics released a meta-study not too long ago that concluded that both asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread is statistically insignificant from 0 so quarantining healthy people is, as it has always been, entirely pointless.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;So I\\'m not sure I understand your argument that the PCR testing isn\\'t a valid tool to determine case load.  Labs don\\'t report the Ct so there is no way to know what your actual viral load is. All you get is a positive/negative result with no information of whether that is even remotely relevant. Furthermore, most labs don\\'t even test for full RNA strands but, instead, just look for one to three different gene sequences so even if you do test positive for COVID at a reasonable Ct you still don\\'t know if you are actually infectious or not. Relying purely on PCR while hiding information is an extremely unreliable way of determining who is actually infectious and who isn\\'t. Then, to go on and use these ambiguous results to justify destroying millions of people\\'s lives through insanely destructive government polices is outright criminal.',\n",
       " 'Do you think “factual teaching” is the current norm?',\n",
       " 'We also teach that Lincoln was the greatest president in US history and could do no wrong while the confederate states where literally Hitler. They play up FDR as being a great leader while denouncing Hoover even though FDR just adopted all the destructive policies from Hoover but cranked them to 11. We are told about the evil robber barons and how great politicians such as Teddy Roosevelt came in to save the American people from these business men whose business practices were raising the standard of living for the common man... We are told that Federal Reserve chairmen are the \"great maestros\" that expertly drive the economy even though they are the ones responsible for the boom-bust cycle. We are told to focus on the atrocities of the Third Reich while mostly ignoring Red China or the Soviet Union. The only thing we ever learn about Andrew Jackson is how evil he was for the trail of tears but never do we hear about his stance on central banking. We are taught about how bad \"yellow journalism\" was and how thankful we should be for the super trustworthy news organizations that we have today...  In general, schools teach a very left leaning pro-authority picture of American history that puts certain political elites on a pedestal. Nitpicking over false equivalents just seems silly in light of this.',\n",
       " '&gt;Confederate states went to war because they wanted to maintain slavery. No shit they are portrayed as evil.  Except the south didn\\'t want war and many prominent northern abolitionist advocated for secession so that northern states would no longer have to abide by fugitive slave laws which would have effectively ended slavery in the south peacefully. Furthermore, the issue of slavery wasn\\'t even relevant in the first 18 months of the war.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I agree FDR is over accredited.  I don\\'t think \"accredited\" is the word you were looking for.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Teddy did many praise worthy things, the greedy rich (the true elite because lets face it, basically all politicians are bought) werent held accountable for monopolies (which stifle innovation) or actually having regulations on silly things like food and drugs.  This is the generic argument you hear in school but it hardly tells the truth. People love to attack Rockefeller\\'s Standard Oil as an evil monopoly that was harming the consumer even though their efficient business model was successful in lowering the price of refined oil from 30 cents in 1869 to just 6 cents in 1897. By the time Roosevelt moved to dissolve the company in 1911 their market share had already declined to just 25% through natural market forces. Even left leaning historian Gabriel Kolko wrote that starting in 1899 Standard Oil had \"entered a progressive decline in its control over the oil industry\" which he said was \"primarily of its own doing\" and \"the responsibility of its conservative management and lack of initiative.\" So even a \"big evil monopoly\" like Standard Oil had to constantly innovate in order to stay competitive.  Andrew Carnegie became a steel tycoon precisely because he was able to employ highly efficient practices and incentive structures. His small plant that he opened in 1875 in Pittsburgh employing less than 5000 men was able to produce 3 times as much steel as the renowned and modernized Krupps plant in Europe which employed 15,000 men. The price of steel rails fell from $160 per ton in 1875 to just $17 per ton in 1898 thanks to Carnegie.  The argument that \"evil monopolies\" were engaging in \"predatory\" practices to the detriment of consumers just doesn\\'t seem to hold water. A monopolistic firm, by definition, is a firm that restricts output in order to gain economic benefits but in all of the industries that were accused of acting monopolistically, output continued to rise and prices continued to fall at a rate that greatly outpaced the rest of the economy.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Lets not forget national parks  The national parks were basically just so that he could have federal land to hunt on.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;the Nobel he won for ending a war.  Teddy was a notorious warmonger. Representative Thomas S. Butler who was on the House Naval Committee wrote that \"Roosevelt came down here \\\\[to Washington\\\\] looking for war. He did not care whom we fought as long as there was a scrap.\" He jumped at the idea of a possible conflict with Mexico and offered his ranch hands as cavalry. He supported President Cleveland\\'s anti-British stance on the Venezuelan boundary disputes and wanted to go to war with Britain in order to conquer Canada. He wrote in a letter to Lodge that \"...this country needs war\" which prompted the President of Harvard, Charles W. Eliot, to scold Roosevelt\\'s \"doctrine of jingoism, this chip-on-the-shoulder attitude... of a ruffian and a bully.” His entire gubernatorial campaign in New York was founded on the issue of war by ridiculing Democrats for being too soft and \"unpatriotic\".  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Lincoln definitely deserves that praise, he stitched together a nation through civil war, inspired soldiers ON the battlefield, and sacrificed not only his life, but his sons and marriage to save our country.  Lincoln started the war in order to consolidate power. Seven states had already seceded before Lincoln was president and the four other states didn\\'t secede until after Lincoln mustard 75,000 troops to invade the south. He was a creature of his time and was influenced by the consolidation efforts in Italy, Prussia, and Japan to create large centrally controlled countries with a strong sense of nationalism. The northern army experienced a large deserter crisis and plummeting war bond valuations after the emancipation proclamation was given. As renowned civil war historian James McPherson puts it, \"\\\\[Union soldiers\\\\] were willing to risk their lives for the Union, but not for black freedom... They professed to feel betrayed.\" So it\\'s a bit of a stretch to say that Lincoln \"inspired soldiers\".  Let\\'s also not forget about the northern army\\'s war crimes and total disregard for the European code of warfare which forbade the targeting of civilians.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And we are taught all about how Andrew Jackson stopped the federal reserve but just because you make a few good policies does not justify fucking genocide  The Federal Reserve didn\\'t come into existence until 1913. Jackson\\'s veto of the renewal of the Second Bank of the United States is taught in passing but no teacher ever explains how significant this is or how it relates to todays insane monetary system (probably because the vast majority of teachers and historians are economically illiterate). They focus entirely on the bad while ignoring the significance of the good.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;next you\\'ll be defending Hitler for improving Germanys economy.  Except he didn\\'t. He just created an unsustainable top-down system that would have collapsed by itself. The fact that they produced a bunch of tanks, rifles, warships, and bombers to fight a war (as did FDR) is hardly an indication of economic prosperity.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I agree that almost all modern journalism is tainted and is arguably yellow journalism but at least they cite things.  In other words, they are better at creating the illusion that they are journalist.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Left leaning or right leaning nationalism is nationalism. We do not need to \"teach\" patriotism. If your country is great you should find pride in it, if it can\\'t move you to pride you should make it so you CAN be proud of it.  American patriotism is finding virtue in the idea of individual liberty and self governance rather than admiring authority and centralized decision making. There is nothing admirable about using the power of government to pass laws in order to mold a country into something that you personally think is worthy of pride.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Lets not forget how Trump is simply trying to push the ugly under the rug.  Like how historians avoid talking about Lincoln\\'s tyrannical side while demonizing southern states who had the legal right to secede.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Hell, he wants to reinstate Columbus day, you know the guy who raped girls as young as 9, wiped out the Taino people, and arguably began the triangular slave trade.  You can write a hit piece on almost any historical figure. Why should we ignore all the nuances of history in favor of a romanticized version? Why should we demonize the Europeans while applauding the natives when the Native Americans were engaging in bloody wars and slavery between themselves as well? The natives in Mexico sided *with* Cortes because of how much they hated the Aztecs and their lust for enslaving lesser tribes for human sacrifice.  The history of mankind is riddled with brutality and there is no definitive \"good guys\" vs \"bad guys\".',\n",

The union and the politicians get to decide how to spend the taxpayers money with no say from the taxpayer. Not exactly a fair setup.  My mother was a teacher but lived in a state where joining the union was optional and since she actually put effort into her job she never needed to waste money by joining the union.

Joe Biden declared himself the winner before a single vote was certified even though he publicly promised that he wouldn\\'t. Where is the outrage over that? Hillary Clinton to this day still says that she was the legitimate winner of the 2016 election. Where is the outrage over that? Al Gore was exceptionally salty after losing to Bush in 2000 and would regularly introduce himself as the \"former next president of the United States\" while constantly griping about being the real winner since he won the popular vote. Where was the outrage over that?  Has anyone apologized for blatantly lying to the American people about the baseless RussiaGate scandal? Has anyone served time for committing crimes in order to illegally overthrow a president? Did you just start paying attention to politics a couple months ago?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I know that you’re mainlining copium and have bought into the narrative that they have this evidence but have been cucked by “procedural issues”, but these are Trump appointed judges that have laughed this out of the courts.  For starters, whether a judge is appointed by Trump or not is entirely irrelevant. Judges in general are notoriously spineless when it comes to elections. On top of that, Trump hasn\\'t exactly been very good at appointing \"yes men\" despite what the corporate press has claimed. John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Bill Barr... These have all been establishment hacks who don\\'t care about Trump so what makes you think that any of the Judges would care either? They would rather just keep their cushy jobs and not have to make tough decisions. It\\'s easy to play along in order to get an appointed position but then when the establishment comes knocking and tells you to get back in line, most people obey.  Secondly, you make it seem like the cases were not thrown out for procedural issues when, in fact, they were. That\\'s not really up for debate but I guess you have bought into the narrative that there is absolutely no evidence even though there are hearings going on where people are presenting evidence under oath. Of course, the corporate press is hardly covering them or instantly dismissing it with no actual counter argument since they want the masses to be left in the dark in order to run down the clock. Why is big tech censoring anyone who questions the 2020 election when they didn\\'t do that to the 2016 election? There is already insanely more evidence that this election was stolen than the 0 evidence that they had that the 2016 election was stolen and yet, big tech and the corporate press are suppressing information as much as possible. Interesting... What are they so afraid of? Why is there so much push back for any kind of meaningful forensic audit or fair investigation? Wouldn\\'t they want to be as transparent as possible in order to assure that the election was as fair as they claim it was? What are they hiding?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If you honestly believe that there was fraud that occurred this election perpetrated by Biden, then you are a fucking joke.  It didn’t necessarily have to be perpetrated by Biden. Usually beneficiaries of election fraud are left in the dark so that they can maintain plausible deniability but if you are under the impression that there aren\\'t glaring issues and massive irregularities that the establishment and their buddies in the media and big tech are doing everything they can to sweep under the rug, then you are a fucking joke.',\n",

The house rushed for a vote on party lines to send two ridiculously weak articles of impeachment to the senate after they realized how flimsy their case was.

I\\'m saying you are exhibiting tribalistic tendencies by making apologies for Biden for breaking his own EO that he just signed the other day after one of his biggest talking point during his \"campaign\" was how it was every American\\'s duty to wear a mask. He has a whole team of people following him around and advising him everywhere he goes so if he isn\\'t wearing a mask, which he has constantly preached about, then it is a deliberate decision. The only real conclusion that anyone can come to is that he is full of shit and knows that masks are worthless but wants to appease all the mask zealots that still believe in their mystical powers by signing a totally inconsequential EO. It\\'s all a dog and pony show for people like you who don\\'t know any better.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Well, I would point out that everyone gushes about what a sincere compassionate guy Biden is. Even Mitch McConnell likes him.  Of course Mitch would, he\\'s a generic establishment crony just like Biden. Mitch has far more in common politically with Biden than he does with Trump as does the rest of the Washington machine. Furthermore, most people hate Biden so I don\\'t know where you are reading all of these puff pieces about Joe \"Big Man\" Biden being a \"compassionate guy\". The establishment and MSM didn\\'t even back him until *after* the South Carolina primaries since he was their last hope after Bloomberg turned out to be a massive dud and they sure as hell weren\\'t going to get behind Bernie.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Nobody has ever defended trump as honest , or having integrity. So, how is it the same thing?  What you meant to say was, \"none of the crony establishment politicians or the media pundits that act as the PR branch for the crony establishment politicians have ever defended Trump.\" If you think that Biden is an upstanding guy who has never lied during his entire career as a crony political elite then you are living on a different planet. Biden is basically the embodiment of Washington corruption and anyone who actually pays attention to politics knows this. Don\\'t let the puff pieces fool you.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Trump lies about everything and does whatever suits him. He doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt. He has questioned every precaution, all the while claiming to work hard and do a great job on Covid and “One life is too many ... but blame China and wear a mask only if you want to, it’s not for me.”  I can see you have been drinking the kool-aid. Just a heads up, masks and lockdowns provide no public health benefit.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You can say they are all corrupt and Biden has made mistakes, but the truth is that Biden is at least trying to do the right thing.  No, he\\'s not and it\\'s actually comical that you think this. He has spent his entire career in Washington doing whatever was most politically convenient so why would he all of a sudden start caring about others?
